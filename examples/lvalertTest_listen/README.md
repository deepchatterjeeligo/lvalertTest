this is an example of how you can trigger an executable vi lvalertTest_listen in exactly the same way as it would be triggered by LVAlert itself.

To run this example, make sure you've set up your environment so that both lvalertTest and lvalertMP are discoverable. Then simply run

    ./doit

This script contains helpful comments that should explain how the procedure is conducted.

Note, you can easily modify this to watch and publish the messages generated by FakeDb by supplying a --fakeDB-dir option to lvalertTest_listener.
